## PLANT EVOLUTION SIMULATION
The simulation shows a population of plants (roughly based on plants in the mustard family).
The lifecycle is shown, from germination to growth of leaves, buds, flowers, and seedpods.
The seedpods eventually drop their seeds, the old plants whither away, and a new population grows.
Users can select which plants the seeds for the new generation will be from.
This will model the process of evolution of the population by artificial selection (selective breeding).
If users do not make selections, the population will anyway evolve through natural selection.
Various events will be simulated in which certain plants will be destroyed, 
leaving other plants to produce seeds for the next generation.
## TODO
  - [✓] fix: stems growing away from stalk
  - [✓] Add backgrounds
  - [ ] fix: some buds are not opening - order is off
  - [ ] some leaves are turing into buds
  - [ ] When season is clicked before all seeds have fallen, the new plants grow from above ground
  - [ ] fix; Do not let new season be clicked until all seeds have fallen to the ground
  - [ ] Make the seedpod and open it in the SeedPod class
  - [ ] Give all the leaves on a plant the same final stemlength
  - [ ] Make the seedpod appear when the seedpod opens, as the flower grows
  - [ ] If no plants were selected before pressing new season, select all plants and drop all seeds
  - [ ] streamline the organisation 
  - [ ] can we make a clock function that keeps increasing time and is used to set the flow?
  - [ ] Eventually make a slider to speed up and slow down time
  - [ ] Make all the leaves on a plant rather similar to each other
  - [ ] In the initial population, make the leaves on each plant quite different from those on other plants
  - [ ] Adjust parameters for leaf width and length in new generation
  - [ ] Adjust colours and make new generation inherit colours 
  - [ ] put a tiny bud at the top of the growing stalk
  - [ ] Make the number of leaves a selection variable
  - [ ] Make the number of seeds in all seedpods on a plant a selection variable
  - [ ] Make the final seed size a selection variable
  - [ ] Adjust distances between stems and make multiple buds at the top of the growing stalk
  - [ ] Make flower petals dry up and fall off as the seedpod grows
  - [ ] LEAF: Make a new, improved leaf
  - [ ] Make old plants whither away
  - [ ] Make plants bend over
  - [ ] Make a timer mechanism to generate new seasons without the users
  - [ ] User testing
  - [ ] figure out the legal aspect
  - [ ] test version on itch  - [ ]
  - [ ] Make multiple bolts of lightning
